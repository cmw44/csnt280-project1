For this project, you will create a web interface that will allow a user to login by supplying a
correct username and password. The web interface will consist largely of two pages, a
login.php page and a page called home.php that is the landing page when a user logs in
successfully. There will also be a PHP script called handleLogin.php that will receive POST
data from the login.php page and perform the authentication.
The login.php page will consist of two input boxes and a submit button that allow a
user to submit a username and password. The password should not be visible as plain text
when the user enters this value. The home.php page will simply state that the user has logged
in successfully.
